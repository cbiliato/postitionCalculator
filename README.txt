# PositionCalculator
PositionCalculator code for ENGG1410

Calculates the closest user to any given user based off a text file containing any number of other users.

Follow the directions the program gives you and you should be fine.
Please make sure that the text file follows the format of:

[# of other users]
[lat of user] [long of user] [altitude of user] [time elapsed since broadcast in nanoseconds] [name of user]
[lat of user] [long of user] [altitude of user] [time elapsed since broadcast in nanoseconds] [name of user]
[lat of user] [long of user] [altitude of user] [time elapsed since broadcast in nanoseconds] [name of user]
...

(so for example the number of users here would be 3)

Thanks for using our program, we hope it helps!
